# belly-button-challenge

The repository for the belly-button-challenge has the app.js which houses code for all of the plots and interactive elements of the webpage, 
index.html which contains the (starter) code that displays the website correctly and adopts app.js, and samples.json, which I believe is just 
the JSON of the code we pulled from the internet. I found this challenge to be difficult and therefore did not have the time to complete the 
optional assignment, the gauge graph, although I would have liked to found the time to complete it. Please let me know if there are any issues 
with the submission. As this code was a bit more complex, I am not sure whether my commenting was sufficient or not. Thank you for grading my 
assignment. I appreciate your time.

Best,
Andrew
